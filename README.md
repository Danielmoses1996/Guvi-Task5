# Guvi-Task5

# Data Collection and Preprocessing
Collect historical data of resale flat transactions from the Singapore Housing and Development Board 
Preprocess the data to clean and structure it for machine learning.

# Feature Engineering
Identify relevant features that can impact resale prices, such as town, flat type, storey range, floor area, flat model, and lease commence date.
Create any additional features that may enhance prediction accuracy, such as age of the flat or average resale prices in the neighborhood.

# Model Selection and Training
Choosing an appropriate machine learning model for regression
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the selected model using a portion of the dataset for training.

# Model Evaluation
Evaluating the model's predictive performance using regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R2 Score.
Tweaking the model if necessary, considering different hyperparameters or trying alternative models for comparison.

# Streamlit Web Application
Developing a user-friendly web application using Streamlit, a Python library for creating web applications with minimal code.
Allowing users to input details of a flat (town, flat type, storey range, etc.)
Utilizing the trained machine learning model to predict the resale price based on user inputs.

# Deployment on Render
Deploying the Streamlit application on the Render platform or any other suitable platform for web application deployment.
Ensuring that the deployed application is accessible to users over the internet.
